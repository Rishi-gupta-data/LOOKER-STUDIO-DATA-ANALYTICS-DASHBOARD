Specification: In Looker Studio, when you're specifying your dashboard based on your dataset columns, you'll be choosing how to represent each column visually. 
For example: You might represent "Sales" and "Profit" columns as line charts to show trends over time.
"Product Category" and "Region" could be displayed as bar charts to compare sales performance across different categories and regions.
"Promotion Name" could be represented as a pie chart to show the distribution of sales by promotion type.
"Channel" could be visualized as a stacked bar chart to compare sales from different channels.
During specification, you'd also arrange these visualizations on the dashboard canvas, set titles and labels, and choose appropriate colors and formatting to make the dashboard visually appealing and easy to understand.

Filtering: You can allow users to interactively filter the data based on various dimensions in your dataset:
Users might filter by "Order Date" to focus on a specific time period or compare performance between different months or years.
They could filter by "Product Category" to view sales data for specific product categories or sub-categories.
Filtering by "Country" or "Region" could enable users to drill down into sales data for different geographic areas.
"Channel" could be used as a filter to analyze sales performance across different sales channels.
These interactive filters empower users to explore the data from different perspectives and gain deeper insights based on their specific interests or requirements.

Preprocessing: Before visualizing the data on the dashboard, you might need to preprocess it to ensure it's in a suitable format:
You may need to calculate the "Cost of Sales" based on the "Unit Cost" and "Order Qty" columns.
Derived metrics like "Profit Margin" (Profit / Sales * 100) could be calculated to provide additional insights into profitability.
You might aggregate the data at different levels, such as summarizing sales at the monthly or quarterly level for better analysis.
Cleaning the data to remove any duplicates or handling missing values to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Preprocessing ensures that the data is properly prepared for visualization and analysis, leading to more accurate and meaningful insights on the dashboard.
